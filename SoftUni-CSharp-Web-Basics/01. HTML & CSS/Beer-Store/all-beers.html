                <td>
                    Corona Extra is lighter than traditional beers, with a crisp and refreshing taste. This light, dry beer has pleasant malt and hop notes with a round dry finish. 
                    Regardless of the time of the year, Corona is best served ice cold, with a wedge of lime that complements and intensifies the flavour through the palate.

                        Stella Artois is a classic Belgian lager, golden in color with a floral, hop aroma, well-balanced fruity malty sweetness, crisp hop bitterness and a soft dry finish. 
                        All natural ingredients give Stella Artois a clean, crisp palate.

                        It is a 5% abv pilsner beer with a global distribution to 140 markets. It is also known as Carlsberg Lager, Carlsberg Beer and Carlsberg Pilsner. 
                        It was first brewed in 1904, and was created by Carl Jacobsen, son of Carlsberg's founder JC Jacobsen.

                        It tastes like a Pilsner should taste, with noble hops and a dry finish, but with a little more hoppy flavor than the average
                        and a copper like aroma often referred to as skunk. Pilsner Urquell is the classic Pilsner. In the US Heineken is a little expensive 
                        and quite frankly out of style and boring. If you want a similar alternative in the US try Budweiser, which is very underrated and well made 
                        with a classic taste but also considered boring. Leffe Blonde might be more palatable, without the skunk factor everyone mentions.
